user_description: Hello there! I'm John Park (my legal name is "Hokyun Park"). I'm a software developer with a passion for creating innovative solutions. <br> <br> I'm currently working at CIBC and have experience with various programming languages and frameworks. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and challenge myself with new IT-related skills.<br> <br> Outside of coding, I enjoy exercising and playing active sports â€” I guess I'm that weirdo who loves being both active and a developer at the same time!
